- ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub page!  My name is Devin and I'm 24 at the time of this writing.
 
- ðŸ‘€ I enjoy programming and the feeling that solving a difficult problem yields. I'm always trying to learn how to write better code.
    
- ðŸŒ± As of now, I've only dabbled in a small range of programming languages: Javascript alongside HTML&CSS, C++, & C#. I also hope to soon find time to figure out the basics of SQL.
